## Why use **BLA-BOT** in your academic group?

- **Easy to use**: The bot is easy to use and understand. You can add BLA-BOT to your academic group and easily provide information to your fellow students.
- **Cool features**: BLA-BOT has some cool features like GPA info, birthday wishes, announce to your group as bot, additional academic resources and much more.
- **Easy to customize**: The bot is easy to customize and modify according to your needs.
- **Secure**: The bot is secure and private. Users only see the data they are authorized to see. Even though any other 3rd party can add your bot to their group, they won't be able to utilize some of the bot's features. (like results, student info, etc.) Some of the features are only available to the group admins.
Additionally, if any unauthorized person tries to access the bot's data, they won't be able to do so. The data is encrypted and only the bot can decrypt it.
- **Unauthorized access alert**: The bot will alert the group admins about the unauthorized access attempts via dm (This only works if you have already interacted with your bot via dm previously).
- **Documentation**: The bot is well documented and has a detailed README file. You can easily understand how the bot works and how to customize it according to your needs.
