# What is Render?

[Render](https://render.com/) is a cloud platform that allows you to deploy your apps in a few clicks. It's free for small projects and has a generous free tier.

:::tip QUICK TIP

If you're planning to use Render Cloud Platform, under the free plan, the bot will be automatically stopped after some time of inactivity (~15 minutes). As a work-around, you can use a service like [Cron-Job.ORG](https://cron-job.org/) (Totally Free) to keep the bot alive in certain times. (Please don't abuse this service by running the bot 24/7 though!)
